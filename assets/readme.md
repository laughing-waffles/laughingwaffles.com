## Adding business ideas

Here are the steps to quickly add a business idea for validation.

1. Make a copy of `_pages/business-ideas.md`
2. Rename the file to anything. The file name will become the url slug.
3. Update the new file's frontmatter with the business idea.
4. Add mockup image to `/assets/img/`, using the same deminsions as `mockup-business-idea.jpeg` (828 × 1792 px)
5. Save the file.
6. It's best to check ina local build for any visual or console errors.
7. Merge changes to Master. Github actions will rebuild and serve the changes within a few minutes.

Woo!
